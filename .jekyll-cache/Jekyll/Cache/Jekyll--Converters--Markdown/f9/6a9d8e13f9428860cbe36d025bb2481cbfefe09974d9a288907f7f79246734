I"¾<p>My mom asked for my help over the weekend with troubleshooting Zoom on her laptop. The microphone wouldnâ€™t work. She could be seen by everyone else but not heard. After monkeying around, I figured out the underlying problem. Zoom wasnâ€™t at fault (surprise). The laptopâ€™s OS (Windows 10) implements a privacy setting that disables microphone usage by default. Once that setting was turned off, my mother could be heard on Zoom calls.</p>
