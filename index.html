  Hi there! My name is CJ. I studied and was involved with music for most of my life — studying classical guitar at school, organizing music events at cafes and art galleries, playing with bands in many forms. Music was shaping to be my livelihood.
</p>
<p>
  But then something changed within me. During grad school I volunteered at an ed-tech project, participating in 60+ hours of podcasts on works of philosophy & literature. This experience made me realize something — I didn't want to teach and perform music professionally for the rest of my life.
</p>
<p>
  So I quit out of my PhD program and searched for what was next. After keeping my eyes peeled, an opportunity came up to work at an IT help desk, no experience needed. This opened the door to possibilities I couldn't have seen before.

  Currently I am the community manager at <a href="https://write.as">Write.as</a>.
