  Hey there! My name is CJ. I studied classical guitar & played in bands.
</p>
<p>
  Then I quit out of my PhD program & served lattes as a barista.
</p>
<p>
  After a while I got the opprtunity to work at an IT help desk, getting into the world of software.
</p>
<p>
  Currently I am the community manager at <a href="https://write.as">Write.as</a> & looking to transition into cyber security.
